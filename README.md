# Strend
This year as the part of our project Strend, we have undertook the following;
/We collected around 100 drafters for Rs100 each from senior batches and sold them to the freshman year for Rs140 each, which saved them from the hurdle for buying a drafter for Rs 750  to be used for only a semester
/We collected 50 lab coats for Rs 150 each from the senior batches and sold them to the freshman year for Rs250 each.
/As the batch of 2019 was vacating the we  organised a collection drive and procured around 330 clothes from the various hostels and we will donate a third of these clothes and sell the other when the rest of the team returns back from summer vacation.
/We also had collected around 40 mattresses from the batch of 2018 from which we donated 17 that were usable to the freshman year and the rest donated to the local vendor to recycle their stuffings.
/We are currently building prototypes of laundry bags from flexes that are leftover across the college from various events, our laundry bags are waterproof and have a holding capacity of over 10kgs. We have donated 27 laundry bags to workers living around the college.


This has helped us achieve the following;

We have created an ecosystem within the college of renting equipment thats required only for a semester or two by procuring the equipment from the senior batches and giving it out to freshman year, while taking in a cut to account for the equipment that gets damaged/worn/torn during usage, the equipments we rent out are liable to be returned to us after their usage by the particular batch for the next upcoming batch.
In the process we generated a revenue of Rs10000 while ensuring that students don't pay an excessive amount of Rs750 for a drafter each and Rs 350 for a lab coat.
This recycling reduces carbon emissions and is a step forward to create a sustainable future for us all while helping the unprivileged in our society, like the freshman students who do not hail from a well to do family and the workers living around the college
